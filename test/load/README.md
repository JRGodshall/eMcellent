#Bulk File Tester

Given the extension to and modification of the M/MUMPS language over time, bulk execution of files can ensure that 100% fidelity is maintained by this parser.  This loader allows you to specify a directory, which will be recursively scanned and each file evaluated.

This is primarily used against the OSEHRA issued VISTA instance of .M files.
